What I learned in this practice how to extract required elements from the original design file how to write the basic frame of the page in HTML css knowledge learned in this practice How to extract required elements from the original design fileIn this practice ,the PSD file I used as the original file was downloaded from the template website Pixlhint Below are some summaries I learned from this practice about extracting from original design file. Give a general look to the design file When get the design file ,the first thing should be openning it in a gallery view to have a general look about the whole page. To determine which part should be common part and which part should be individual part in the page ,so that can determine the file structure when start to write the page code. Do not put every element to a picture When start to get material from the design file ,should always think about it ,what do I need to cut as a picture and what I can use CSS to get the same result. it is better to use CSS if the material is easy to get rather than put it as a picture How to write the basic frame of the page in HTMLIn the basic HTML page ,I use HTML5 tags to structure the page frame, semantization is part of the HTML5 standard ,semantization tags such as &lt;header&gt; ,&lt;nav&gt; ,&lt;artile&gt; ,&lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; and so on. When add selector to tags in the page, we should consider which tag we should add a selector ,not just used for CSS but also need to consider the usage when we need to use javascript in the page. The selector name should be WYSIWYG, such as class=&quot;header-nav-list&quot; or class=&quot;nav-list-item&quot;.
